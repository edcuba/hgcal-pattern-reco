# Pattern recognition for HGCAL reconstructions

This repository documents the AI approach to trackster smoothing for CMS HGCAL reconstructions, developed in the scope of a master's thesis in [Pattern recognition for particle shower reconstruction](https://www.merlin.uzh.ch/publication/show/23612) by [Eduard Cuba](mailto:eduard.cuba@uzh.ch).

The content is distilled from the [original repository](https://github.com/edcuba/TICLPatternReco), covering data preprocessing and model training.
